										<h1>Why does Puerto Rico need help?</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We are a Latinas who are heart broken to see an island that makes a fraction of the latin community in need of aid and help after two devastating hurricanes left the island in ruins. With their national government cutting aid, they need our help more than ever.</p>

									<h2>End of Section 936</h2>
									<p>	Section 936 was a tax credit that was almost equal to tax liability allowing business and companies' revenue they make in Puerto Rico basically Tax Free.</p>

									<p>The End of Section 936 is what lead to a decreasing economy. When large technological companies left the island and had no thought of returning. The abandonment of companies and businesses lead to high rates of unemployment and average house income rates to lower to the point 43% of the population living below the united states poverty line. The End of Section 936 is what began this slow yeat constant drop of the economy.</p>

									<p>On May 3rd, 2017 Puerto Rico files for Bankruptcy, $79 Billion in debt including the $49 billion unpaid pensions. During the period of economic downfall, professionsals (including medical professionsals) began leaving the island for higher paying jobs. Most saw the constant pattern of economic donwfall and knew they had better opportunities out of the island, but their love for Puerto Rico was too great. Their hope resonated among each other to look towards the future, not stuck on the present situtaion. </p>

									<h3>Hurricane Maria</h3>
									<p>On September 6th, 2017, Huricane Irma, a category 4 (later turned 5) hit the northern coast of Puerto Rico, leaving those hit wihtout power. Exactly two weeks later, on September 20th, 2017, Hurricane Maria, a category 5, tore through the center of the small island of Puerto Rico, leaving the entire island without power for months. Thanks to the Jones Act, it took TWO WEEKS before aid was brought to Puerto Rico, even with FEMA's aid it wasn't enough. Undistributed supplies layed in cargo ships for days, even weeks, before they were distributed. Electrical grid was out for months, taking 8 months before majority of the island was restored with electricity. Althought the electrical grid was repaired, its very fragile, resulting in island wide blackouts frequently. June 2018, FEMA announces pulling housing, food, water, and other forms of aid from Puerto Rico. Matters are getting better, but not as great as they should be after FEMA aid. Many are migrating off the island, especilaly younger generations, because they have lost hop for the future of the island at this point.</p>

									<h4>Where does the Future Lead with schools and hospitals closing?       </h4>
									<p>When Section 936 came to an end, the economy began to take the consiquences. As the economy began to fall, professionals began to leave. The lower the economy me got, the greater flow of professionals and their famlies leaving the island, indluding medical professionals. This resulted in a island wide shortage of medical professionals, to the point hopsitals, pharmacies, and clinics bagan to close down because of lack of funding. July 2018, has been reported that Puerto Rico has hit critically low amount of medical resources and now the island being labeled as a humanitarian crisis.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									 <p>With the Government of Puerto Rico $79 billion in debt, schools began losing government funcing. Thanks to lack of funding, schools slowly began to clsoe their doors. Students no longer attending school, and teachers no longer teaching. The hope for the future begins to decrease and then shatters after Maria hit the island. In April 2017 a total 293 schools had closed, now 300+ have closed after Maria. Now, not only are even more schools are at risk of closing, but also Colleges and Universities are now at risk of closing because of lack of funds and donations. </p>
